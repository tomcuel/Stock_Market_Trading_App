# ‚öôÔ∏è Mutex-Concurrent Trading Engine ‚Äî C++ Server + Python Stress Test

This project implements a **multi-client trading engine** in **C++**, designed to test **mutex efficiency and correctness** under high concurrency.  
It includes a **Python stress-testing script** that launches many clients sending random buy/sell orders simultaneously, all interacting with a shared order book.

---

## üß© Overview

This setup demonstrates how to safely coordinate **concurrent reads and writes** to a live trading engine using:
- `std::shared_mutex` for **per-symbol order books** (multiple readers, one writer)
- `std::mutex` for **individual client portfolios** (strict ownership)
- A **per-client thread model** for communication and processing
- A **Python load test** that stresses the server with random orders to check for race conditions, deadlocks, or inconsistent trades

## üß† Architecture

### üîπ Core Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Server (C++)** | Handles multiple TCP clients, processes buy/sell orders, matches trades, and keeps order books consistent using mutexes |
| **Client (Python threads)** | Each simulated trader connects, sends random orders, and receives trade confirmations |
| **Mutex System** | Fine-grained locking ensures data integrity between concurrent operations |
| **Matching Engine** | Processes and matches limit orders in FIFO-like priority queues |

---

## üß± Mutex Model

| Mutex | Type | Scope | Protects |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|
| `market_mutexes[symbol]` | `std::shared_mutex` | Per-symbol | Each order book (buy/sell queues) |
| `portfolio_mutexes[client_id]` | `std::mutex` | Per-client | Portfolio cash & holdings |
| `client_sockets_mutex` | `std::mutex` | Global | Connected clients table |

**Locking Rules**
- `std::shared_lock` is used for **viewing** market data (`VIEW MARKET`), multiple readers, market snapshots can be accessed in parallel
- `std::unique_lock` is used for **modifying** order books (`BUY` / `SELL`), one order at a time modifies a symbol‚Äôs order book, there is no data races, all shared resources are protected by appropriate mutexes
- Portfolio updates (cash, holdings) are isolated by `std::lock_guard` on the client‚Äôs own mutex, it never blocks other clients

This ensures:
- **No deadlocks:** Lock order is consistent (market first, portfolio next)
- **High concurrency:** Different symbols and clients can operate in parallel

---

## üí∞ Matching Engine Logic

1. **Order submission**  
   Clients send commands like:
   ```yaml
   BUY 10 AAPL LIMIT 145.5
   SELL 5 AAPL LIMIT 144.0
   ```
2. **Order matching**
- BUY orders match lowest-priced SELLs
- SELL orders match highest-priced BUYs
- Matching continues until no compatible orders remain
3. **Trade execution**
- Updates buyer/seller portfolios atomically under their mutexes
- Sends [TRADE] confirmation to both clients
4. **Unmatched leftovers**
- Are stored back in the order book for later matching

## üßÆ Internal Data Structures

### Internal Data Structures

Global registry of all order books, one per traded symbol (e.g: market["AAPL"] gives access to AAPL's order book)
```cpp
std::map<std::string, OrderBook> market;
```
Each symbol (e.g., "AAPL") has its own order book.
- Buy orders: priority queue sorted by descending price (best bids first)
- Sell orders: priority queue sorted by ascending price (best asks first)
```cpp
struct OrderBook {
    std::priority_queue<Order, std::vector<Order>, OrderCompareBuy> buyOrders;
    std::priority_queue<Order, std::vector<Order>, OrderCompareSell> sellOrders;
};
```
Each client owns a Portfolio structure storing cash balance and holdings (symbol ‚Üí shares)
```cpp
std::unordered_map<int, Portfolio> portfolios;
```

### Synchronization Layer
1. `market_mutexes[symbol]` protects order books for a given symbol ‚Üí `std::shared_mutex` allows concurrent readers (for VIEW operations) but exclusive write access for order matching or order insertion
```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::shared_mutex> market_mutexes; // symbol-level locks
```
2. `portfolio_mutexes[client_id]` ensures thread-safe portfolio updates ‚Üí standard std::mutex since portfolios are modified frequently but rarely read in parallel by multiple threads.
```cpp
std::unordered_map<int, std::mutex> portfolio_mutexes;             // per-client locks
```
3. `client_sockets_mutex` guards the socket registry to prevent race conditions during client connection / disconnection
```cpp
std::unordered_map<int, int> client_sockets;                       // client_id ‚Üí socket descriptor
std::mutex client_sockets_mutex;                                   // protects client_sockets map
```

### Concurrency Summary
- Matching Engine threads (one per client) call `process_order()` under a `unique_lock<shared_mutex>` for the symbol in question. This ensures exclusive access when modifying the order book
- Read-only operations such as `VIEW MARKET` acquire `shared_lock<shared_mutex>` allowing multiple clients to read concurrently
- Portfolio updates use `lock_guard<std::mutex>` per client to ensure atomic modification of balances and holdings
- Network socket operations use client_sockets_mutex to safely add, remove, or send messages across multiple client threads

## üß© Server Commands
| Command | Description |
|--------|--------|
| `BUY <qty> <symbol> LIMIT <price>` | Submit buy order |
| `SELL <qty> <symbol> LIMIT <price>` | Submit sell order |
| `VIEW MARKET <symbol>` | View buy/sell queues |
| `VIEW PORTFOLIO` | View current cash & holdings |
| `exit` |¬†Disconnect client |

## üîÑ Example Session
Client 1:
```yaml
BUY 10 AAPL LIMIT 150
[ORDER] client 1 -> BUY 10 AAPL LIMIT 150
[TRADE] 1 bought 10 AAPL from 2 @ 149
```
Client 2:
```yaml
SELL 10 AAPL LIMIT 149
[ORDER] client 2 -> SELL 10 AAPL LIMIT 149
[TRADE] 1 bought 10 AAPL from 2 @ 149
```
Server logs:
```yaml
[TRADE] 1 bought 10 AAPL from 2 @ 149
Client 1 connected!
Client 2 connected!
```

## üß™ Stress Testing the Mutex System
The Python script `mutex_concurrency_test.py` spawns multiple simulated clients that hammer the server with random orders.

### Run the stress test
```bash 
./launcher.sh
```
It does include the build of the `server.x` file with the `makefile`, launch `mutex_concurrency_test.py` and the cleaning afterward.

### Configurable Parameters
Inside `mutex_concurrency_test.py`:
```py
CLIENT_COUNT = 10           # number of concurrent clients
TEST_DURATION = 1           # seconds each client runs
HIGH_CONTENTION_SYMBOL = "AAPL"
```

### Log Outputs
After the test, all messages (client logs, orders, and trade events) are saved to `nrt_stress_test_log.txt`
```yaml
